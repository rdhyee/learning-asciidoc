How does indenting of a section work?

Let's use a sample from a little Hamlet.

Output of just indenting the passage surrounded by newlines:

    To be, or not to be, that is the question—
    Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
    The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
    Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
    And by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—
    
vs surrounding indented passage with `+....+`:

....
